-allows the travel agent to enter the amount in pounds sterling (GBP) that the customer wishes to convert

-allows the travel agent to choose the currency requested by the customer

-converts the amount entered in GBP to the chosen currency

-calculates a transaction fee depending on how much in GBP the customer converts

-calculates the total cost (amount to convert plus transaction fee) in GBP of converting to the chosen currency

-applies a discount of 5% to the total cost if the customer is also a member of staff.
